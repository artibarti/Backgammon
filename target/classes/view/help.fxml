The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The quadrants are referred to as a player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The home and outer boards are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board called the bar. &#10;The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's home board. The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also the opponent's one point. Each player has fifteen checkers of his own color. The initial arrangement of checkers is: two on each player's twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point, three on each player's eight point, and five on each player's six point. &#10;The object of the game is move all your checkers into your own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all of their checkers wins the game. &#10;&#10;The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward, to a lower-numbered point. The following rules apply:&#10;&#10;- A checker may be moved only to an open point, one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. &#10;" wrapText="true" />
