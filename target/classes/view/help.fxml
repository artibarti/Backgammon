Both player has a base, and the goal of the game is to reach that base with all the checkers belong to the player.

It is possible that a player can't step, in this case the game is going on, and the opponent has his/her turn.&#10;&#10;You can win by step to your base with all of your checkers. You can start step out from the table when all your checkers are in the last quarter of the board (near to your base).  When you step out to your base, it is not necessary to have the exact number of fields between your field and the end of the board as on the dices.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game the first player to reach his/her base with all his/her checkers.&#10;" wrapText="true" />
